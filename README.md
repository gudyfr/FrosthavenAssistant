> Scenario 1 of Gloomhaven with starting classes of X-haven games

## Introduction
**X-Haven Assistant** is a helper app for **Gloomhaven** and its family of board games. The app currently supports **Gloomhaven**, **Frosthaven**, **Jaws of the Lion**, **Forgotten Circles**, **Crimson Scales**, **Trail of Ashes**, and any derivatives including solo, custom, and retirement scenarios. 

This is a feature-complete replacement for the defunct Gloomhaven Helper app. This single-screen app streamlines combat and minimizes the need for user input. It complements physical play by tracking monster turns, enforcing scenario-specific rules and spawns, facilitating loot deck construction and enhancement, and much more. Multi-device control is available via local area networking. Please note that campaign progress is not within scope of this combat helper app.

- Networking:
  - To start a server, be sure to be on a wifi network and press 'start host server' from the settings menu
  - To connect to a server in a local network, type in the local ip of the server (usually 192.168.something) and press 'Connect as client'.

## Connection Usage

### Starting
- From the settings menu, have one device start a server. Be sure to be on wifi or ethernet (a local IP will be shown i.e. 192.168.X.XXX)
- A Port can also be defined if needed. Be aware that ports under 1024 are typically blocked. If using a port, make sure to allow port forwarding in your router's settings. Search the internet for this
- Other devices on the same network may connect from the settings menu, by typing in the host server's IP and port. There are two IP numbers, local IP address and public IP address. Try the first one

### Info
- Be aware, when connecting to a server, the server's game state will overwrite the local state
- Mobile devices might cut connections when they are not in foreground. This is especially crucial for Server device: Best to put the server on a windows or mac if available
- Clients will try to auto reconnect when coming back to foreground if connection was cut
- If a client gets out of sync with the server (by disconnecting, or making an update before it gets the latest state from server), the client's state change will be ignored and overwritten by latest state from server to get you back on track. And a message index out of sync will be shown
- There should be no issue having several users change things simultaneously: the menus will not close when getting an update
- Local settings are not affected by the game state (Except for no standees option). It is up to the users to decide on options that affect the game

## Known Issues
- Does not handle character modifier decks
- Severe flickering on lineage os 16, 17 and 18 on older phones using adreno 300 series graphic chip.
- Some animations will not play, (and some may play when they shouldn't) when receiving updates over wifi
- When trying to connect without a server on same network, may result in a lot of error messages shown when it tries connecting
- A device sharing a wifi-hotspot can not connect itself
- Initiative is secret while not originating from your own device in a network. It will stop being secret if you do modify it yourself
- Some text alignment issues with small texts on small screens
- Condition Animations do not play when connected
- When connected and the server device goes to background, the connection may be broken. Try to avoid having the server device's app go to background
- All data is added by hand. Please report any error in a ticket on Github

## Roadmap
- Next:
  - Something special
  - More minor improvements
- And then:
  - Maybe language support

## Developer Notes

#### Calculations
health and attack may be using a string formula instead of integer.
Calculations handle division (integer only) '/' rounds up, 'd' rounds down
multiplications (* or x means same thing)
addition (- or +)
and parenthesis.
variables: C (nr of characters), L (scenario level)

#### Special Rules
Allies: 
 - need a "list" of strings of monsters
Timer: 
 - "startOfRound": optional boolean,
 - "list": integers of the rounds in which to display note. -1 means all rounds
 - "note" - test to display
Objective/Escort:          
 - "name" - name of character
 - "health": - string with the calculation for health with C,L etc.
 - "init": - preset initiative
LevelAdjust:,
 - "name" - string, the monster id
 - "level" - integer, the disparity from regular level (i.e. -1 means one level lower)
Named or otherwise special enemies are not added as special rules, but as their own monster type
Since named monsters are like bosses, they should be added as if they were a boss (i.e only one type instead of normal+elite types)

#### special signs for text layout
 - *small style - only used for longer texts usually.
 - ^mid style - also denotes subline in case last line was main line sized. if you want a line to be a subline you NEED to use this or ^^.
 - ^^mid style squished. makes the line height smaller. can cause alignment issues if text contains icons. best to use this from the second row onwards in a text block.
 - ! to the right of (don't use this. is being used internally. prefer the "[r]"+"[/r]" way.)
 - £ yellow
 - | draw only condition, not the text (for FH style, ignore this. the text is removed automatically)
 - Å invisible text - used for force aligning text, since whitespace by itself gets disregarded. also empty lines, since height of empty string is variable :(
 - '>' disables stat calculation (useful for grant abilities)
 - "[r]"+"[/r]" row "[c]"+"[/c]" column - put items between in row or column.
 - "[s]"+"[/s]" for row in column in row. only used for element use case.
 - ¤ treat as image instead of WidgetSpan - using actual image size (use this for aoe graphics)
 - *......... create divider
 - **......... crete divider with smaller height.
 - [newLine] used to force break line for the sublines (gray boxes: it is ont correct style, but necessary to fit calculated values in some cases.
graphics can be placed at exact position like this:
[{
"gfx": "aoe-line-4-with-black",
"x": 0.73,
"y": 0.36,
"angle": -30.0 //don't use angle unless you have to since the pivot point is not in center.
}]
added before the lines.
FH special considerations:
 - write as if gloomhaven style, the algorithm will move the sublines up when applicable.
 - algorithm will find if is subline by looking for ^ after a mainline.
 - algorithm will find conditional block (dotted edge) by looking for keyword: '%use%'
 - algorithm will make first ^ line after a use-element to be main line when reasonable (e.g. conditions, and added attacks)
 - if you need a subline to be in 2 parts, one to the right and one below, add empty row like this to separate: "[r]","[/r]",
 - don't use ^^ on first line of subline of conditional block as the gray background will be squished as well and look bad.
 - subline text is somewhat larger than the physical counterpart due to the fact it was just too small to see easily on smaller screens.
